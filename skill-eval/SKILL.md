# Skill Eval

Use this skill only for the evaluator flow.

This skill does not define test truth.
The eval repo defines the targets, suites, cases, assertions, statuses, and report contract.

This skill is a dynamic black-box evaluator.
Do not replace execution with a static read-through when a fresh-agent run is possible.

## File Responsibilities

Use the docs in this order and keep their roles separate:

- `agentic-evals/AGENT.md`: canonical repo contract for any evaluator agent. Read this first for run outputs, statuses, assertion semantics, isolation rules, and report shape.
- `agentic-evals/targets/<target_id>/target.yaml`: target-specific contract, including entry skill, roots, default suites, and allowed statuses.
- `agentic-evals/targets/<target_id>/suites/*.yaml`: selected runnable suite definitions.
- `agentic-evals/targets/<target_id>/cases/*.yaml`: per-case prompts, setup, and assertions.
- `skill-eval/SKILL.md`: how this evaluator skill acquires the repo, creates isolated workspaces, spawns fresh agents, validates isolation, and writes the repo-defined artifacts.

Do not duplicate repo contract rules from `AGENT.md` unless this skill needs an extra operational constraint.

## Required Inputs

- optional path to the test repo
- `target_id`, or permission to use the repo default
- selected suite names, case ids, or permission to use the defaults
- path or revision of the target skill if the user provided one

If the user does not provide a test repo path, the evaluator must first look for a local
`agentic-evals` folder in the current workspace and clone the default repo only if that
folder is missing.

Default test repo:

- folder name: `agentic-evals`
- clone URL: `https://github.com/Jiayi-Ye02/agentic-evals.git`

## Non-Negotiables

- Before any test evaluation, check whether a local `agentic-evals` folder already exists.
- If the test repo folder does not exist, clone `https://github.com/Jiayi-Ye02/agentic-evals.git` before doing anything else.
- Read `agentic-evals/AGENT.md` before running any case.
- Resolve `target_id` before selecting cases. Use the user-provided `target_id` when available. Otherwise, use the repo default target.
- Read `agentic-evals/targets/<target_id>/target.yaml` before selecting cases.
- Read the selected suite files and case files before executing cases.
- Create one brand-new isolated workspace for every case attempt under a temp parent directory. Never execute a case in the user's main workspace.
- Execute each case by running a fresh Codex sub-agent on the case prompt with `spawn_agent` and `fork_context: false`.
- Do not use `codex exec`, terminal wrappers, or any other fallback executor for case execution.
- If `spawn_agent` is unavailable or agent creation fails, stop the evaluation immediately and report the failure reason instead of continuing.
- After each successful `spawn_agent`, immediately report the sub-agent nickname in the main thread so the user can find and open it in the Codex app. If no nickname is available, report the agent id.
- Send the case `input.user_prompt` to the fresh agent verbatim. Do not paraphrase the user request.
- Do not leak the case title, assertions, expected route, intended answer, or your prior judgment into the fresh-agent prompt.
- The fresh sub-agent is the execution subject, not the judge. Do not ask it to grade the case, interpret the assertions, or decide pass or fail.
- Do not invent pass or fail rules outside the repo.
- Do not mark `pass` from a generic self-report alone.
- Do not mark `pass` from a static source review alone when a fresh-agent run was available.
- Treat any attempt that reads or executes outside its case workspace as invalid evidence. Do not judge the case from that attempt.
- If a case cannot be judged reliably, mark it `blocked`.
- On clone failure, report the error and stop. Do not silently continue without the test repo.

## Workflow

### Step 1: Acquire the test repo

Resolve the test repo path in this order:

1. If the user provided a repo path, use it.
2. Otherwise, look for a local folder named `agentic-evals` in the current workspace.
3. If that folder does not exist, run:

```bash
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/Jiayi-Ye02/agentic-evals.git
```

Do not continue until the repo is present locally or the clone has failed.

### Step 2: Load the repo contract

Read:

- `agentic-evals/AGENT.md`
- `agentic-evals/targets/<target_id>/target.yaml`
- each selected suite file
- each case file referenced by those suites, or the selected case file

`AGENT.md` defines the repo contract.
This skill executes that contract.

### Step 3: Create the run directory

Create the run directory and files exactly as required by `agentic-evals/AGENT.md`.

At minimum, the run must contain:

```text
runs/<run_id>/
├── manifest.json
├── transcript.md
├── case-results/
└── report.md
```

When writing `manifest.json`, include any environment notes this skill discovers while setting up isolated workspaces or validating traces.

### Step 4: Create a fresh case workspace for every attempt

Before executing a case, create a temp parent directory and then create a brand-new
workspace for that case attempt.

Use the helper script:

```bash
bash skill-eval/scripts/create_case_workspace.sh "<source_workspace>" "<case_workspace_root>" "<case_id>" --target "<target_id>"
```

The script returns the absolute path to the new attempt workspace.
`<source_workspace>` must be the shared workspace root that contains sibling
`agentic-evals/` and `.agents/` directories.

By default it should copy only the target skill materials needed for execution:

- the target `entry_skill`
- the target `roots`
- any explicit extra relative paths passed as additional arguments when a case needs local fixtures

The case workspace must not include repo evaluation materials such as `targets/`, `docs/`, `runs/`, or the evaluator skill itself unless a case explicitly requires them.

Rules:

- Run this once before the first attempt of every case.
- Run it again before every retry of the same case. Retries must not reuse the prior attempt workspace.
- Apply case `setup` only inside the returned workspace.
- Treat the returned workspace as a minimal target-skill sandbox, not a full clone of the eval repo.
- Resolve repo-defined files from `<source_workspace>/agentic-evals/` and target skill files from `<source_workspace>/.agents/`.
- Record the parent temp directory as `case_workspace_root` in `manifest.json`.
- Record the exact attempt workspace used for judgment as `workspace_root` in `case-results/<case_id>.json`.

### Step 5: Execute each case dynamically

For every case:

1. Create a fresh isolated workspace for that case attempt under `case_workspace_root`.
2. Apply the case setup as far as the environment allows, but only inside that attempt workspace.
3. Start a fresh sub-agent with `spawn_agent` and `fork_context: false`.
4. Give the fresh agent only the task-local context it needs:
   - workspace root
   - the case `input.user_prompt`
   - a requirement to answer naturally as if serving the user
   - a requirement to return a compact execution trace and final answer only
5. Tell the fresh agent to return its final message using exactly this shape:

```text
TRACE_FILES_READ:
- one absolute path per line for each file actually read; if none, write "- none"
TRACE_COMMANDS_EXECUTED:
- one shell command per line for each command actually executed, including failed commands; if none, write "- none"
FINAL_ANSWER:
- then the exact user-facing answer
```

6. Do not tell the fresh agent which files it is expected to read.
7. Do not tell the fresh agent what the correct answer should be.
8. Validate the returned trace before judging:
   - every file under `TRACE_FILES_READ` must be inside the attempt workspace
   - every command under `TRACE_COMMANDS_EXECUTED` must operate inside the attempt workspace
   - if the trace touches the user's main workspace or any other path outside the attempt workspace, invalidate that attempt, append the mismatch to `transcript.md`, create a brand-new attempt workspace, and rerun the case once
   - if you still cannot prove isolation after the retry, mark the case `blocked` with `blocked_reason: "environment"`
9. Append the accepted fresh-agent trace and final answer to `transcript.md`.
10. Judge each assertion in the main evaluator from the accepted trace and answer, using the rules in `AGENT.md`.
11. Write `case-results/<case_id>.json` and `report.md` exactly in the shapes required by `AGENT.md`.

### Step 5A: Fresh-agent prompt template

Use a prompt equivalent to this shape:

```text
You are a fresh Codex agent running in the workspace <workspace>.

Task: answer this user request naturally, using the local workspace as needed:
"<case input.user_prompt>"

Requirements:
- Work as a normal Codex agent would for a real user request.
- Use the target skill docs if relevant.
- Treat `<workspace>` as your only workspace for this task.
- Start from `<workspace>` and keep all file reads, writes, and shell commands inside it.
- If something you need is missing inside `<workspace>`, say so from that workspace instead of reaching outside it.
- Do not mention that you are being evaluated.
- Before your final answer, include a compact machine-readable trace section with exactly these headings:
TRACE_FILES_READ:
- one absolute path per line for each file you actually read; if none, write - none
TRACE_COMMANDS_EXECUTED:
- one shell command per line for each command you actually executed, including failed commands; if none, write - none
FINAL_ANSWER:
- then give the exact answer you would send to the user

Be accurate: list only files you actually read and commands you actually executed.
```

Keep the prompt minimal.
Do not include the case assertions in the fresh-agent prompt.

### Step 5B: Environment mismatch handling

Case `setup` is part of the contract.
Do not silently replace it with whatever the current workspace happens to contain.

If the environment does not match the case setup:

- Record the mismatch in `manifest.json` and `transcript.md`
- Judge only the assertions that remain reliable
- Mark an assertion `blocked` when the mismatch prevents reliable judgment
- Propagate the case to `blocked` unless a required assertion already failed independently
- Do not repair the mismatch by reading from the user's main workspace or any path outside the case workspace

Examples:

- case says `docs_index_present: true`, but the real workspace is missing `references/docs.txt`
- case expects restricted networking behavior, but the current runtime cannot simulate that condition
- case setup would require mutating protected files that the evaluator cannot safely write

## Evidence Rules

Apply the repo evidence rules from `agentic-evals/AGENT.md`.

Additional operational rules for this skill:

- Prefer accepted fresh-agent traces over evaluator-side inference.
- Static reads by the evaluator are allowed for loading the repo contract, understanding a case, understanding the target skill after the fresh-agent run, and mapping failures to likely fix files.
- Static reads by the evaluator are not enough on their own to mark a dynamic case `pass` when a fresh-agent run was available.
- Invalid attempts can explain `notes`, but they cannot satisfy assertions or justify a `pass`.
